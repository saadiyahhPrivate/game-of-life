Game of Life


<header> Design Decision: </header>
<p> Collecting the changes to be made to the grid in the following generation so as to avoid altering the current state of the canvas. then applying the changes. </p>

<p> Enabling scaling of the canvas to any dimension by passing it as an argument when the grid is initialized</p>

<p>The game is not wrapping around, it is an infinite grid but at the borders, we do not wrap around to the other side.</p>
